## Urban Coexistence

* The Greater Horseshoe Bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) is native to Europe, North Africa, and Asia
* The GHB is Near Threatened (IUCN), protected under EU Habitats Directive and Wildlife and Countryside Act in the UK
* A GHB can live up to 30 years
* GHB’s need Woodland, Grassland, Farmland and Urban areas especially buildings and barns
* For GHB’s connected habitats are very important for:
* Providing a diverse range of insect populations
* Mating and to be able to find roosts
* Migration, by providing safe spaces to move between summer and winter roosts
* Sites like Hogs Wood provide a rich foraging areas while reducing disturbance from human activity, providing roosting sites and reduced light pollution
* One way to protect the GHB is to designate roosting sites, for this more surveys would be needed
* Greater Horseshoe Bats thrive in variable and connected habitats, and urban areas can play a crucial role in their conservation
* Urban planning must consider Hogs Wood as a wildlife corridor and potential as summer roosting site for GHB’s
