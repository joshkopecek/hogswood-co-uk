## Habitat Needs

* Slow Worm (Anguis fragilis) are native to Europe and Western Asia and can live up to 30 Years
* Slow worms need Grasslands, Hedgerows, Woodland edges, Gardens and allotments â€“ all of which are provided in hogs wood
* In the summer Slow worms Forage for invertebrate in gardens, grasslands, and hedgerows
* In the winter slow worms hibernate in compost, under logs or discarded corrugate iron or in burrows
* Hogs wood provides a number of connected habitat in close proximity
* This helps slow worms access diverse food resources
* Enables slow worms to find partners over larger areas
* Safe hibernation sites
* When habitat become fragmented by buildings, fences or roads this prevents slow worms mating and can increase mortality both by the development and due to the fragmented habitat reducing food resources
* To helps support the Slow worms of Hogs wood we need to:
* Help preserve and improve the wildlife corridors
* Maintain and provide more safe hibernation sites
* Raise awareness of how important slow worms are for tackling slug population (Gardener best friend)
* Slow Worms thrive in variable and connected habitats, and urban areas can play a crucial role in their conservation.
* Urban planners need to consider wildlife corridors and Slow Worm-friendly practices.
