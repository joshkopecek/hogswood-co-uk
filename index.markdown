## What can we do to support Hogs Wood?

* Designate as Local Nature Reserve
* Habitat Restoration by removing and monitoring invasive/non-native species
* Encourage plant species diversity by removal of dominant vegetation such as brambles in some areas
* Maintain habitat connectivity by not developing Hogs Wood
* Raise awareness through education
* Mandate comprehensive environmental impact assessments before any development project, ensuring minimal disruption to local wildlife and habitats
* Implement measures to reduce light pollution
* Maintain hibernation sites, install bird boxes
* Removal of litter
* Signage
