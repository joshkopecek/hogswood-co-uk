## West Devon Borough Council Announcement

[https://bit.ly/moorlanderhogswood](Moorlander article on announcement)

West Devon Borough Council plans to develop 30-40 homes on two acres of land next to Wonnacotts Road in Okehampton town centre 

Total cost £7.6m, £100,000 allocated for initial planning

Original capacity from previous planning application was 60-70 houses but scaled back after public feedback requesting more green space 

60% of the area will remain as woodland

Public consultation planned 

Mix of social rented homes and supported living accommodation for people with learning disabilities 
£2 million contribution secured from Homes England 

Remaining costs to be recouped through rental income 

218 households with local connection to Okehampton currently on housing waiting list 

Site constraints include trees, flood zones, contamination, and high water table 

£100,000 will fund pre-planning assessment, design work, surveys, and ecology studies before submitting planning application 

This development represents West Devon's response to the local housing crisis while balancing community concerns about preserving green space.

### Protecting our local green space for wildlife and the community.

Hogs Wood is an area of land in Okehampton between Northfield Road, Crediton Road, Neville Road, Wonnacotts Road, and North Road (part of it formerly known as Wonnacotts Meadow). The name ‘Hogs Wood’ identifies the whole area as a place that has evolved into a mixed woodland with meadow, supporting diverse habitats and species including the hedgehog. 

This website brings together its history, the current local groups and local government interests in Hogs Wood. It highlights the knowledge gained through wildlife surveying, local history and people’s stories, research into ownership and the local plan, and highlights opportunities to get involved. The aim is to work together with stakeholders, finding a way forward to permanently protect Hogs Wood for the benefit of wildlife, the environment and people.
